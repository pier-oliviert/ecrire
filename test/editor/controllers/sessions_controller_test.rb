  # From what I could read, functional tests do not play nice with middlewares.
  # So, because I can't rely on Warden::Manager to catch the thrown error here, I 
  # have 2 options: Move to integration testing or work around the issue. 
  # I chose the later for now but I believe that it might be a good idea to move controller
  # testing to actual integration tests. Most of the work is done on the UI anyway so it would
  # cover every cases.
