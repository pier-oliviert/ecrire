module Ecrire
  ##
  # Theme module links the user's theme with 
  # Ecrire::Application. It uses Rails::Engine to hook
  # itself up and split the codebase between the Gem and the user's
  # Theme.

    ##
    # Engine is the foundation of Rails. It can be used
    # to encapsulate part of the application and this is 
    # exactly what it does here.
    #
    # Ecrire::Theme::Engine is the block that hooks into Ecrire::Application
    # to provide Theme support.
    #
    # This class is the only element that the Gem includes at runtime.
    # 
    # Everything else is defined in the user's theme folder.
    #
    # This engine is the reason why it's possible to have 
    # Ecrire as a gem and theme as user's folder.
    #
    class Engine < Rails::Engine

      ##
      # +post_path+ needs to be defined so Ecrire can link from the admin
      # to a post. This is also needed when listing all the titles a post has
      # and the URL they represent.

      # it's highly customized and it was less readable to
      # disable and changes every paths.
